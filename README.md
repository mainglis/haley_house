What MAI did:
- Rescaffolded a few models
- Tried to modify the css in public/default_index.html
- Put updated files on GitHub
- Made the following database task priority list:

1. Link models with primary and foreign keys
2. Put database on Haley House server, A2Hosting.  Note: I'm looking at the phpMyAdmin portal on our server and am wondering if we should go ahead and start editing directly on A2's servers instead of ours.

	a. grants MS Access and Excel files
